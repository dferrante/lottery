Here's a silly helper script for telling you how much money you won with either powerball or megamillions

Usage:
First, enter your numbers, entering any non-number when you are done:

$ python didwewin.py numbers

Then copy numbers into appropriate variable in the top section of the script.  You can also add numbers from a work pool, along with the amount of people in it to see what the individual portion of the winnings is (assuming evenly divided winnings).  When the numbers come in, run the script like this:

$ python didwewin.py 34 5 21 55 8 16

GOOD LUCK!  The odds are against you!
